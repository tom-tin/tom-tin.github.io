### Misc
- [Diffusion Models are Evolutionary Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02543)
  - By making connection between DMs vs EAs, they propose a new method called Diffusion Evolution
  - This method efficiently identifies multiple optimal solutions and outperforms prominent mainstream evolutionary algorithms.
  - What are EAs?
    - Simulate the process of natural selection and evolution, over multiple generations.
    - Use mechanisms like: reproduction, mutation, recombination --> to find optimal solutions.
