## Trends
- Models need to be trainable in fewer epochs, with fewer augmentations and less data.

## Highlighted Models
- Yolo12.
- [Vision AI for anomaly detection: A quick overview](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/vision-ai-for-anomaly-detection-a-quick-overview)
  - Explore how computer vision enables precise anomaly detection in various industries. Learn how to custom-train models like [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-ultralytics-yolo11-and-its-applications) for anomaly detection.
  - The smallest object detection model, [[YOLO11n](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/), has just 2.6 million parameters - about the size of a JPEG.
  - The largest object detection model, YOLO11x, has around 56 million parameters, and even that is incredibly small compared to other models.
  -  You can train them on a cheap GPU, like a five-year-old Nvidia GPU.
