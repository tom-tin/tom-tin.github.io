## Trends
- Models need to be trainable in fewer epochs, with fewer augmentations and less data.

## Highlighted Models
- Yolo12. [Fb post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/279262991363820/permalink/623670850256364/?mibextid=wwXIfr&rdid=XnZMVu4myAzUIsNX&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fp%2F15JZnkY8Rh%2F%3Fmibextid%3DwwXIfr#)
  - Now integate with attention mechanism. Use Area Attention (A2) and Residual Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (R-ELAN). This increase mAP while still fast enough for real-time app.
  - A bit about Attention Mechanism.

  - Explore how computer vision enables precise anomaly detection in various industries. Learn how to custom-train models like [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-ultralytics-yolo11-and-its-applications) for anomaly detection.
  - The smallest object detection model, [[YOLO11n](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/), has just 2.6 million parameters - about the size of a JPEG.
  - The largest object detection model, YOLO11x, has around 56 million parameters, and even that is incredibly small compared to other models.
  -  You can train them on a cheap GPU, like a five-year-old Nvidia GPU.
