[dataclasses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/understanding-python-dataclasses/)
- A new utility in Python 3.7. Like normal classess in Python, but have some basic funcs like instantiation, comparing, printing.
- Used to create classes that are purely config/container (ie.e, to store data), rather than classes to simulate logic/behaviors.
- Can make classess less wordy. See above link [for an example](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/understanding-python-dataclasses/). 
- field is a func within dataclasses, to control attributes of a class.
