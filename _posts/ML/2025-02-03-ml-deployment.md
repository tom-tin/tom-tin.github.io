# Simple Examples
* Source: [How to Quickly Deploy Machine Learning Models with Streamlit](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-quickly-deploy-machine-learning-models-streamlit/).
  * Deploy to Streamlit Cloud. Not consider: MLOps, Scaling.
  * I created my adaptation in this repo [deploy_streamlit](https://github.com/tom-tin/deploy_streamlit/tree/main). I made a few changes compared to the original source and noted these in README.md.
