## General Tips for choosing platform
- Training models with GPU: Kaggle vs Colab. [Video by MiAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXnrFGjSwrY)
- Case: Train a model <=50M para (e.g. ResNet50) with GPU. What are the options?
  - Vast.ai: cheap, but charge when you upload data. Servers are outside VN, hence upload speed can be slow. Better to connect to Drive then upload data.
  - runpod.
  - modal.ai.
  - Kaggle or Colab: 50M is still manageable, just need to save model and re-train multiple times.
