# Understand MMM
- A statistical method to study the impact of marketing campaigns on different metrics, e.g., traffic, clicks, conversions, sales.
- It is not a new approach.
- Every MMM model is more or less a regression.
  - Xs: campaign spends+activities, an other control variables:
    - Macro-economic factors (GPD, unemployment rate)
    - Seasonal factors: holidays, events.
    - Competing variables: competitor's spending.
    - Price changes or promotions.
    - External factor: Weather.
    - Group indication: region, city
  - Y: ROI, KPIs.
    - revenue, conversion, customer acquisition.
  - Usually: based on MLE.

# Why bother?
 - Understands your past campaigns to make decisions in the future: budget allocation.
 - What was my ROI? How did a certain channel (e.g., Facebook) drive my revenue or other KPI of interest?


# Meridian (Google)

### Why Meridian?
- Traditional MMMs: use standard regression --> MLE: need a lot of data to be stable. No info about uncertainty.
  - Provides only point estimates of each coefficient.
- Bayesian MMMs:  Bayes Theorem + MCMC sampling to estimate coeff.
  - Provides est. of distribution of coeff.
  - Bayesian models work better when having less data or with missing values, or being too sparse.
    - Thanks to assumption about Prior.
   
### Concepts
- Adstock: models the effect of spend on sales being not instantaneous but accumulating over time.
- Saturation: models the effect of spend onf sales being not linear but saturates at some point (i.e., diminishing returns).
### Other features
- Geo-level modeling: Meridian can perform hierarchical modeling.
  - Meaning you can model multiple regions together.
  - This is a good tradeoff between having separate models (unpooled) vs one single model that averages all regions (pooled).

### Components
- Y: signal
- Xs:
  - Adstock (the main x). It's called Media variables.
    - with slope, Hill function, geometric decay rate. 
  - External control covariates (z).
  - Intercept, Stochastic Intercept.
    - time-varying, to account for trend, seasonality.
   
### Example use cases
- [Effect of different ad channel spending on weekly sales](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/new-generation-marketing-mix-modelling-with-meridian-e831a0906b40).
  - ```pip install google-meridian```
  -  Control variables: holidays.
  -  Can viz the contribution by baseline and marketing channels on top of baseline.
    - Results can be sensitive to different model's parameters.
  - Can have ROI for each channel.
  - Can use the result to optimize budget: it propose an optimal allocation of spends to maximize revenue.
    - Use response curves: they describe the relationship between spend and the resulting incremental revenue.
    - Use that to viz diminishing points. But Meridian offers optimizer for you!

## Bayesian MMM
* [Bayesian MMM](https://getrecast.com/bayesian-mmm/).
  * Use Bayesian Statistics, esp. MCMC sampling which is flexible to incorporate prior domain knowledge. --> Can be complex. --> Hence, there are a few best practices to help with building a Bayesian Regression Model. 
  * Incremental Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI).
    * Diminishing Returns (Saturation Rates) of ROMI. Model using Hill Function.
  * Adstock Rates (Carryover Effect).
