# A quick comparison by ChatGPT
Bottom line:
- Use Azure AI Foundry if you need pre-trained foundation models & AI agent development
- Use Azure ML Studio if you want to train custom ML models from scratch
- Use Azure AI Studio if you want to fine-tune pre-trained AI models for applications

# Get Started
- https://ai.azure.com/ --> Sign in --> Create a new project.

# Learning resources
- [Azure AI Foundry documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/)
  - The ULR is actually "ai-studio". Hence I think it is just an upgrade of Azure AI Studio.
