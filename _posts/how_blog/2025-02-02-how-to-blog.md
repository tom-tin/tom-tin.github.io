# General
* After committing changes to your_blog.md file, it takes about 30s for the GitHub page to show the updates.
* Remember to change the date value accordingly to make your blog appear on Github page. Also, this is an example how to include an image.
  
 ![Change Date Value](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tom-tin/tom-tin.github.io/master/_posts/how_blog/pictures/change_date.png)
 *  The following relative path will work in preview mode of github, but not in github page.
 *  For github page to show the image, must use the absolute path.

# Folders/Files management
* Can move a blog.md file into a subfolder of _post and the blog still shows up on Github page.
* Create a new folder by creating a new temp file with that folder as its parent.
