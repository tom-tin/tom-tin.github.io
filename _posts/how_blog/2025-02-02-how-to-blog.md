# General
* After committing changes to your_blog.md file, it takes about 30s for the GitHub page to show the updates.

# Folders/Files management
* Can move a blog.md file into a subfolder of _post and the blog still shows up on Github page.
* Create a new folder by creating a new temp file with that folder as its parent.
