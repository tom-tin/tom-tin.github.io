# General
* After committing changes to your_blog.md file, it takes about 30s for the GitHub page to show the updates.
* Remember to change the date value accordingly to make your blog appear on Github page. Also, this is an example how to include an image.
  * A relative path to the image works fine in preview mode in github. However, github page needs the absolute path to the image to show it.

# Folders/Files management
* Can move a blog.md file into a subfolder of _post and the blog still shows up on Github page.
* Create a new folder by creating a new temp file with that folder as its parent.
