- [The Challenges and Realities of Being a Data Scientist](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-challenges-and-realities-of-being-a-data-scientist-47755feb3cfb/). Author's free newsletter: [Dishing the Data](https://newsletter.egorhowell.com/).
  - Overwhelming new research. Check [Machine Learning category on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent): Can be > 50 papers per day.
  - Undefined Role. I totally agree. We are not DA, DE, MLE, BA, BI, etc. but somehow the union of all these. Even with the same title DS, the actual JD varies from companies to companies, or within every small group of a company.
  - Competitive job market. Undefined Future.
