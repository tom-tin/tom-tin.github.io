# Articles
- [How I Cracked the Meta Machine Learning Engineering Interview](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-i-cracked-the-meta-machine-learning-engineering-interview-aa32f64b8e4b)
  - Coding: 3 rounds = 6 questions. Medium Leetcode. Check out Leetcode top-10 Facebook-tagged questions.
    - Communicate clearly: (1) understanding (2) describe algo and complexity at a high level (3) implement (4) test
    - Bias for speed: During (2), bias for a sub-optimal solution that you can write quickly.
  - Design interviews: 2 rounds: system design, ML system design.
    - System design: solve a problem with a distributed system.
    - ML system design: solve a problem with ML, e.g. build a classification system or a rec system.
   

# System Design
## Tips
- Be proactive: you have to be the one to drive the conversation.
- Outline: (1) clarify the problem (2) propose a high-level design (3) draw out the design (4) zoom into certain components
