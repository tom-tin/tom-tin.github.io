# Behavior
## Tips
- Use STAR method: Situation/Task: what's the problem. Action: what initiative did you take and why? Result?
- You can resuse the same situation but highlight a different facet.
- You can exaggerate within reason.
## Example questions
- What project are you most proud of?
- How did you handle conflict / disagreement with a colleague?
- Tell me me about a time when you took initiative.
- Tell me about a time where you started collaboration across teams.
- Tell me about a time when you had competing priorities.
- Tell me about a time when business requirements changed and you had to adapt.
- Tell me about a time you accepted feedback from your manager.
- Tell me about a time when the problem you were solving was ambiguous.
