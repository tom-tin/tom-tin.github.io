## Type summary
- Bar plots: < 10 categories. 3 types: regular, grouped, stacked.
- Box plots: show distributions, more info than histogram.
  - IQR = 25th to 75th range.
  - Whisker on each side: from edge of the box on that side extend by 1.5*IQR
  - Observations outside the whisker are outliers
- Scatter plots: show 2 variables, but you can also add color, circle size for more info (3d, 4d). Also check out the 4d bubble plots ref below.
- Flow charts: [Lucidspark](https://lucidspark.com/), [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages).

- [5 Steps to Amazing Visualizations with Matplotlib](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-steps-to-amazing-visualizations-with-matplotlib-ca61f0ec5fec/).
  - If known, matplotlib is good enough. If want fancy, use Seaborn.
  - For interactive dashboards: Flask and Bokeh. 

## Advanced
- [4-Dimensional Data Visualization: Time in Bubble Charts](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-dimensional-data-visualization-time-in-bubble-charts/).
  - Bubble charts typically display 3 dimensions using x, y, and bubble size, but adding time as a 4th dimension can provide deeper insights.
