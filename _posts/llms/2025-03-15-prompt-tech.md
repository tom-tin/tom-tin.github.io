* Chain of Thought.
  * Bad: cost of excessive verbosity in their intermediate outputs, which increases computational overhead. 
* Sketch-of-Thougth (SoT):
  * a novel prompting framework that combines cognitive-inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to minimize token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy
