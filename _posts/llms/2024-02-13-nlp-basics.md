## General
- Understanding the LSTM Layer. [Linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/groupPost:961087-7290418174666162177/).
  - Understand this before learning about Transformers.
  - What makes Transformers better: they overcame the sequential processing limitations of RNNs/LSTMs. This enables MUCH faster training through GPU parallelization.
