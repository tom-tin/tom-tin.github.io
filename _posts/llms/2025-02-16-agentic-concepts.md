## Courses
- [Fundamentals of Agents](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit0/introduction) (by Hugging Face). lib: smolagents, LangChain, LlamaIndex.

## Why bother?
- [Why Agentic RAG over traditional RAG](https://www.facebook.com/groups/miaigroup/permalink/1827814437989820/?mibextid=wwXIfr&rdid=E4rFMY51Tqh1fgpS&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fp%2F18m3S6gThA%2F%3Fmibextid%3DwwXIfr#)?
  - Traditional RAG:
    - constrained by static workflows, lack the adaptability required for multi-step reasoning and complex task management.
    - Use LLMs for straightforward QA.
  -  Agentic RAG: represents an advanced approach that enhances traditional RAG systems by integrating intelligent agents capable of autonomous decision-making and multi-step reasoning.
    - employs specialized agents to navigate complex queries requiring detailed analysis and planning.
    - These agents function similarly to expert researchers, adeptly retrieving relevant information from multiple sources, comparing data, and synthesizing comprehensive responses. 

## Applications
- Research assistance, customer support, knowledge management.
