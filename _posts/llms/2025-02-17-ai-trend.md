- AI future (by Yann LeCun). [Fb post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/binhdanhocai/permalink/651767490645342/?mibextid=wwXIfr&rdid=e6jr4rbeNhh5sgqM&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fp%2F1AMgrjvcyq%2F%3Fmibextid%3DwwXIfr#)
  - Both LLMs and Reinforecement Learning (RL) have limitations.
  - RL: consume a lot of resources, hard to scale, RL models hard to adapt when env changes frequently, can't plan long-term.
    - Instead, try Self-Supervised Learning. 
  - LLMs: can create content but cannot "undestand" the world, limited in planning and high-level reasoning capabilities.
  - New propposed approach: JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture):
    - AI don't need to predict the next step/token, but learn the abstract about how the world operates.
    - Learn from video, photos, sounds rather than just text.
    - Can plan before act, just like human.

* Why SLM is now the trend?
  * Only a few bil para, but trained on specific tasks hence increase accuracy.
