After seven years, I feel like blogging again! I first created this blog during the final phase of my Ph.D. program at Northwestern. I figured this would help boost my profile a bit to get into the job market at that time. Of course, this is the advice I've got from the senior fellows and others on the Internet. I got my first job offer and I doubted that the hiring managers cared about reading these. Time flies. I was too busy and there was not much motivation to continue writing and sharing on this platform.

I am at the point of getting more experience in the field of data science. After all those years in this field, I've learned a lot from reading other blogs and I am very thankful. I used to keep a personal note of the things I've learned in a Google document. Gradually, that Google Doc was getting too long and I had to divide it into four separate documents. Most of my notes were not well-organized because it was intended for myself only.  

I am 37 years old when I write this particular blog post. I am expected to be a father next year. I realize that I am at a point in my career (and my life) when I would rather do what I want to do than do what I have to do. My desire to learn new knowledge is still burning! With my humble starting point in the field, I love to keep improving myself.

So, this post is to create a new knowledge-sharing journey and I want to keep it going as long as I am alive and having free time!
