# Git Pull
- error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge: logs/dbt.log
  - Confirm that issue is to "Changes not staged for commit": run ```git status```
    - In my case, it is due to this file "logs/dbt.log" was not staged and committed. I don't want to.
    - For some people, there were no such a file and this error still occurs. Same solution here.
  - Delete the problematic file (here, dbt.log)
  - Run  ```git reset --hard```
  - Confirm that there is no more changes needed to be staged: run ```git status```
  - Retry run ```git pull```
