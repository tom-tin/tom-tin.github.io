Abstract: 

Abstract—Online networks enable agents to better observe the 
behavior of others and in doing so potentially learn from their
actions. A key feature of models for such social learning is that
information cascades can result, in which agents ignore their 
private information and blindly follow the actions of other agents.
This paper considers the impact of noise in the form of 
observation errors in such a model. Similar to a model without noise, we
show that with noise, both correct and incorrect cascades happen,
with the same level of fragility. However, with noise, it is harder to
overturn a cascade from one direction to the other. Using Markov
chain analysis, we derive the net welfare (payoff) of each agent
as a function of the agent's private signal quality and the error rate. We
show, somewhat surprisingly, that in certain cases, increasing the
observation error rate can lead to higher welfare for all but a finite
number of agents. In such cases, we compare and contrast adding
additional noise with simply withholding observations from the
first few agents. Our analysis assumes that all erroneous 
observations are available on a common database; however, we also discuss
relaxing this assumption.We conclude by discussing the impact of
different tie-breaking rules on the probability of wrong cascade
and the impact of bounded rationality on the agents’ welfare.
